    <h1> BIG BENG THEORIES </h1>
    <p id="textone"> The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics, philosophy,
        and
        metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:</p>
    <div id="divone">
        <h2 id="texttwo"> BIG BENG THEORIES</h2>
        <p id="textthree"> This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and
            evolution of the universe. The Big Bang theory suggests that the
            history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8
            billion years ago. As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all
            matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.</p>

                <p>
                    Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions
                    where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black
                    holes interact with nearby matter and can emit radiation.</p>

        <h3 id="text7">String Theory</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="text10"> 
        <p id="text8"> String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description 
            of the physical world. According to this theory, we live in a 
            three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might 
            contain additional microscopic, non-material "strings" 
            (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with
             different sizes and characteristics.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="text11"> 
        <p id="text12"> Here are three key points about String Theory:</p>
        <ul id="ul1">
            <li id="p1"><img src="./Rectangle 2332.png">
                Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that
                 explains all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, 
                 electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.</li>
                 <li id="p2"> <img src="./Rectangle 2332.png">
                    Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory proposes the 
                    existence of additional microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing 
                    the laws of physics.</li>
                    <li id="p3"> <img src="./Rectangle 2332.png">
                        Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks of matter are not
                         point-like particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies,
                          with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type </li>
